This is the configuration I use for my laptop, which runs the
**[i3-gaps window manager](https://github.com/Airblader/i3)** (a fork of i3) on
**[Arch Linux](https://www.archlinux.org/)**.

## Setup

The configuration files in this repo are managed via [gnu stow](http://www.gnu.org/software/stow/),
a symlink farm manager which takes distinct packages of software and/or data located in separate
directories on the filesystem, and makes them appear to be installed in the same place.
